### {{< fa server >}} 

Course MA7BY020: Exploratory Data Analysis is an introduction to the principles and practice of data exploration and visualization using the R programming language.
Keeping an eye on Machine Learning and Data Science, the course will cover the following topics:

- Tabular data manipulation
- Data visualization
- Univariate and bivariate analysis for qualitative and quantitative data
- Multivariate analysis starting with multiple linear
- Matrix methods based on Singular Value Decomposition: PCA, CA, CCA, ...
- Clustering methods
  
### {{< fa user-graduate >}} 

After that course, you will be able to:

- Handle tabular data using R version of the relational algebra (`dplyr`)
- Visualize data using `ggplot2` and `plotly`
- Perform univariate and bivariate analysis, compute and assess statistical summaries
- Perform multivariate analysis using matrix methods
- Diagnose and validate the results of multivariate analysis
- Perform, discuss and communicate the results of SVD factorization methods
- Perform, discuss and communicate the results of clustering methods
- Communicate the results of the analysis in a clear and concise manner using Quarto reports, presentations, and dashboards

### {{< fa brands r-project >}} 

The course is based on the R programming language, the RStudio IDE, and the VS Code Ide.
We will rely on the `tidyverse` package and attempt to take advantage of `R` tidy evaluation
mechanisms to write expressive and efficient code.

We will use the `quarto` package for reproducible research.
