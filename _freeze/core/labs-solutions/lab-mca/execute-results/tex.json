MCA belongs to the\nfamily of techniques used in geometric data analysis (Le Roux and Rouanet 2004). It\nallows for the extraction of the most important dimensions in a set of categorical variables,\nand the graphical representation of variable categories and individuals relative to each\nother in a coordinate system. Distances between categories as well as individuals can be\ninterpreted as a measure of (dis)similarity: If categories often co-appear in individual's\nresponses, they are located close together in the space produced by MCA. Rare co-appearances, \naccordingly, result in a larger distance between the respective categories.\nFurthermore, *illustrative variables* can passively be projected into the field, a technique that\nhas been termed *visual regression analysis* (Lebart et al. 1984). Whereas the space is\ndetermined by the distances between the categories of *active variables*, *passive variables*\ndo not alter the structure of the constructed field, but appear in their average and hence\nmost likely position.\n\nFrom [https://doi.org/10.1007/s11135-016-0458-3](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11135-016-0458-3)\n\n\nIn this lab, we won't look at the field of ideological and political attitudes, but rather at the field of confidence level in a variety of institutions. \n\n\n\n\n## Multiple Correspondance Analysis\n\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n\n### MCA executive summary\n\nThe input of multiple correspondence analysis is a data frame $X$ with $n$ rows and $p$ categorical columns. Multiple Correspondence Analysis starts by building the *indicator matrix*. The indicator matrix is built by *one-hot encoding* of each categorical variable.\n\n\n- A categorical variable $V_j$ (factor) with $q$ levels is mapped to $q$ $\\{0,1\\}$ -valued variables $V_{j,r}$ for $r \\leq q$\n\n- If levels are indexed by $\\{1, \\ldots, q\\}$, if the value of the categorical variable $V_j$ from row $i$  is $k \\in \\{1, \\ldots, q\\}$, the bina$\n$$k \\mapsto \\underbrace{0,\\ldots, 0}_{k-1}, 1, \\underbrace{0, \\ldots, 0}_{q-k}$$\n\n- The indicator matrix has as many rows as the data matrix\n\n- The number of columns of the indicator matrix is the sum of the number of levels of the categorical variables/columns of the data matrix\n\n- The indicator matrix is a numerical matrix. It is suitable for factorial methodss\n\n\nRecall $X$ is the data matrix with $n$ rows (individuals) and $p$ categorical columns (variables)\n\nFor $j \\in \\{1, \\ldots, p\\}$, let $J_j$ denote the number of levels(categories) of variable $j$\n\nLet $q = \\sum_{j\\leq p} J_j$ be the sum of the number of levels throughout the variables\n\n\nLet $Z$ be the incidence matrix with $n$ rows and $q$ columns\n\nFor $j\\leq p$ and $k \\leq J_j$, let $\\langle j, k\\rangle = \\sum_{j'<j} J_{j'}+k$\n\nLet $N = n \\times p = \\sum_{i\\leq n} \\sum_{j \\leq p} X_{i,j}$ and\n$$P = \\frac{1}{N} Z$$\n\n(the _correspondence matrix_ for MCA)\n\n{{< fa hand-point-right >}} The row wise  sums of correspondence matrix $P$ are all equal to $1/n=p/N$\n\nThe column wise sum of the correspondence matrix $P$ for the $k$th level of the $j$th variable of $X$ ( $j \\leq p$ ) is\n$$N_{\\langle j,k\\rangle}/N = f_{\\langle j,k\\rangle}/p$$\n\nwhere $f_{\\langle j,k\\rangle}$ stands for the relative frequency of level $k$ of the $j$th variable\n\n$$D_r = \\frac{1}{n}\\text{Id}_n\\qquad D_c =\\text{diag}\\left(\\frac{f_{\\langle j,k\\rangle}}{p}\\right)_{j \\leq p, k\\leq J_j}$$\n\nIn MCA, we compute the SVD $U \\times D \\times V^\\top$ of the *standardized residuals matrix*:\n\n$$S = D_r^{-1/2}\\times \\left(P - r\\times c^\\top\\right) \\times D_c^{-1/2} = \\sqrt{n}\\left(P - r\\times c^\\top\\right) \\times D_c^{-1/2}$$\n\nCoefficient $i, \\langle j, k\\rangle$  of $S$ is\n$$\\frac{\\mathbb{I}_{i, \\langle j, k\\rangle}- f_{\\langle j,k\\rangle}}{\\sqrt{n f_{\\langle j,k\\rangle}/p}}$$\n   \n   \n\n\n\nMCA consists in computing the SVD of the standardized residuals matrix $S =  U  \\times D \\times V^\\top$\n\nFrom the SVD, we get\n\n- $D_r^{-1/2} \\times U$ *standardized coordinates of rows*\n- $D_c^{-1/2} \\times V$ *standardized coordinates of columns*\n- $D_r^{-1/2} \\times U \\times D$ *principal coordinates of rows*\n- $D_c^{-1/2} \\times V \\times D$ *principal coordinates of columns*\n- Squared singular values: the principal *inertia*\n\n\nWhen calling `svd(.)`, the argument should be\n$$D_r^{1/2}\\times \\left(D_r^{-1} \\times P \\times D_c^{-1}- \\mathbf{I}\\times \\mathbf{I}^\\top  \\right)\\times D_c^{1/2}= D_r^{-1/2}\\times \\left( P - r \\times c^\\top  \\right)\\times D_c^{-1/2}$$\n\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-important title=\"MCA and extended SVD\"}\n\nAs\n\n$$D_r^{-1} \\times P \\times D_c^{-1} - \\mathbf{I}\\mathbf{I}^\\top = (D_r^{-1/2} \\times U)\\times D \\times (D_c^{-1/2}\\times V)^\\top$$\n\n$$(D_r^{-1/2} \\times U)\\times D \\times (D_c^{-1/2}\\times V)^\\top$$ \n\nis the _extended SVD_ of\n\n$$D_r^{-1} \\times P \\times D_c^{-1} - \\mathbf{I}\\mathbf{I}^\\top$$\n\nwith respect to $D_r$ and $D_c$\n\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Question\"}\n\n\nPerform MCA on the indicator matrix. \n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\nYou may use `FactoMineR::MCA()`.

It helps determine which categories contribute the most to the definition of a given dimension.\n\n### **Definition and Calculation**\n\nThe v-test is computed as:\n\n\n$$v = \\frac{p - P}{\\sqrt{P(1 - P)/n}}$$\n\n\nwhere:\n- $p$ = proportion of individuals in a given category for the specific dimension,\n- $P$ = overall proportion of individuals in that category across all dimensions,\n- $n$ = total number of individuals.\n\nAlternatively, the v-test can also be expressed as:\n\n$$v = \\frac{\\text{category coordinate}}{\\text{standard deviation of the coordinate}}$$\n\nThis essentially provides a **z-score**, which follows a standard normal distribution under the null hypothesis.\n\n### Interpretation\n\n- A *high absolute v-test value* (typically above 2 or below -2) indicates that the category is *strongly associated* with the given dimension.\n- *Positive v-test*: The category is overrepresented in that dimension.\n- *Negative v-test*: The category is underrepresented in that dimension.\n- If the absolute value of the v-test is below 2, the association is **not statistically significant** (at a 5% significance level).\n\n### *Why is it useful?*\n\n- It helps *interpret MCA results quantitatively* rather than relying only on visual inspection.\n- It aids in identifying *key categories* that structure the data on a given axis.\n- It provides statistical validation for category contributions to dimensions.\n\nWould you like a practical example or interpretation of a specific MCA result?\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n\n## Symmetric plots \n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Question\"}\n\nBuild the symmetric plots (biplots)  for multiple correspondence analysis.\n\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::::: {.content-visible when-profile=\"solution\"}  \n\n::: {.content-visible when-profile='solution'} \n \n### From the shelf \n\nWe resort to `factoextra`.

Quality & Quantity\n\n> When analyzing survey data, response quality has consequential implications for substantial conclusions. Differences in response quality are usually explained by personality, or socio-demographic or cognitive characteristics. Little, however, is known about how respondents‚Äô political attitudes, values, and opinions impact on quality aspects. This is a striking analytical omission, as potential associations between political values and various forms of response biases and artefacts call into question surveys‚Äô ability to represent ‚Äòpublic opinion‚Äô. In this contribution, response quality is traced back to respondents‚Äô political and ideological dispositions. For this purpose, a relational understanding of response quality is applied that takes into account different aspects of response behaviors, as well as the interrelations between these indicators. Using data from the US General Social Survey (2010‚Äì2014), an empirical typology of response quality is created via finite mixture analysis. The resulting classes are then related to positions in the US field of ideological dispositions constructed via multiple correspondence analysis. The analyses reveal that there are (1) different combinations of response patterns and thus different empirical response types, and (2) that these types of response quality systematically vary with regard to the respondents‚Äô political and ideological (dis)positions. Implications of the findings for public opinion surveys are discussed.\n\n\n",
